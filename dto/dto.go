package dto

// dto - Data Transfer Objects
// These objects are used to transfer data between
// A requestor and a requestor.
// The semantics for tranferring these structs is the same as with evets,
// but contrary to events these are not created, but requested.
// For example one may request the current server state or the current banlist,voteban,mute list
